# LoginAndRegistrationTXT_pet

This is a little Pet Project.

The console program contains a simple Login and Registration algorithm. 

When a person creates an account, the program creates a new .txt file in the "accs" folder, which is named with the person's account name and contains their account password, written during the registration process.

When a person tries to log in, the program checks if a file with their account name exists and checks if the written password is the same as the password in a file.
